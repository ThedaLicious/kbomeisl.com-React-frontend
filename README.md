Welcome to the frontend of my portfolio web application!

It is built in React and Axios and talks to a backend built in Django with a PostgreSQL database hosted on Microsoft Azure! All the data, such as which projects I've done, which ones I'm working on, and the details therein are handled by the backend and the display and styling is, of course, handled by the frontend.
